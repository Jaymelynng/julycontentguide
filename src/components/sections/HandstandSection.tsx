        <p>Organize a classic handstand contest. Can be walking or no walking! Include kids of any and all levels in your gymâ€”the more mix, the better! Kids, coaches, or both. Get creative with locations: beam handstands, vault table, or any part of the gym. Any team gym cast handstand holds would be fun! Catch the fun energy and team spirit.</p>

          <li>If you're not sure how to do that, just let me knowâ€”I can help.</li>
